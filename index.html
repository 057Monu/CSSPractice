            <div class="t-div">

                    <img src="https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518Q2WJp2YL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg" alt="Image1">

                    An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
                    However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
                    Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
                    Here is a simple example:
                    </p>
            </div>

            <div class="div-child">

                <p>
                An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
                    A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.
                    It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
                Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element
                will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
